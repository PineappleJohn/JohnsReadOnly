# JohnsReadOnly
Adds a *"ReadOnly"* attribute to the inspector, works with most values. <br/>
To use, type " [ReadOnly] " before a value. <br/>
This makes the value show in the inspector, but not be editable. <br/>
Much better than adding a giant header saying "DONT TOUCH" with the values.
# How to setup
Just drag in the unity package!
