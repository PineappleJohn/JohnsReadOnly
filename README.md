# JohnsReadOnly
Adds a *"ReadOnly"* attribute to the inspector, works with most values. <br/>
To use, type " [ReadOnly] " before a value. <br/>
This makes the value show in the inspector, but not be editable. <br/>
Much better than adding a giant header saying "DONT TOUCH" with the values.
# How to setup
Put the **Editor** folder within assets, make sure the *ReadOnlyAttribute* script is **NOT** inside the Editor folder. <br/>
Put the *ReadOnlyAttribute* script anywhere except the Editor folder.
